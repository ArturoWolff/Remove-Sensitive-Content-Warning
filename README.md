# Remove-Sensitive-Content-Warning
When your X account is labeled as sensitive, it adds a blue text to all your image and video posts saying the content is sensitive, even if it isn't. This removes it so you don't see blue all over. This is browser-side only. Content remains labelled for others.

To use, go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox on your firefox web browser and Load a temporary addon by uploading the manifest.json or content.js. I tried to pack it as an extention but it kept giving me errors so I gave up.

I do not know if this works for other web browsers.
